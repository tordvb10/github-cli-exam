# Set up project on github from command line

This project is a test projct where everything was done through the command line, no mouse cliking or webbrowser viewing.

The picture below illustrate the code I needed to run in order to make this work. First you'd need som program on your computer, if you not allready have:
<ol>
    <li>
        <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">link to install GitHub on your computer</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://cli.github.com/">link to install GitHub Cli on your computer</a>
    </li>
</ol>

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
